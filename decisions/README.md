# honest-scholar — Decision Log (ADRs)

MADR-style Architecture Decision Records for the `honest-scholar` plugin. Each records
the context, the options considered, the rejected alternatives **and why**, and
links to the spec section + grounding digest. Captured 2026-07-17 during the
design session; the reasoning here is not reconstructable from the specs alone.
Migrates to the plugin's `decisions/` alongside `resources/references/`.

> Purpose beyond the record: this log is the raw material for a planned blog
> post / paper explaining the skills and the reasoning behind them — the intent
> is eventually to write that *using* `honest-scholar` (`paper-synthesis` + `defend`).
