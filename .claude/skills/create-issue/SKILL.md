# Create Issue

When work is deferred, a follow-up is noted, or a problem is found that won't be
fixed in the current change, **record it as a GitHub issue** — not only in a
spec, a PR comment, a code `TODO`, or conversational memory.

**Core requirement: the issue must be self-contained.** Assume whoever picks it
up has *only* two things: the repository content and the issue text. They do not
have this conversation, the PR discussion, or any of your current context. If the
issue cannot be completed from those two inputs alone, it is not done.

This skill also defines the **closing** standard (below) — its `Closes #NN`
half lives in the paired [`create-pr`](../create-pr/SKILL.md) skill; keep the two
in sync.

## When to use

Invoke this whenever you would otherwise leave a loose end:

- "Follow-up:", "deferred", "out of scope", "later", "as a follow-up".
- A bug or limitation you're deliberately not fixing in this change.
- A spec's "Follow-ups" section — each entry becomes an issue.
- A review or audit finding downgraded to "not now".
- A `# TODO`/`# FIXME` you're tempted to leave in the code.

If you catch yourself writing "we should eventually…" — stop and create the issue.

## Process (opening)

1. **Gather repo-grounded context.** Before writing, look up the concrete anchors
   the issue needs: exact file paths, function/class names, line references, the
   spec/ADR/docs page it relates to, the PR/commit where it was deferred. The
   issue cites *committed* artifacts only (paths, symbols, merged PRs) — never
   "the branch we were on" or "the run from earlier".
2. **Write title + body per [STYLE.md](STYLE.md).** Follow that template exactly:
   title convention, required body sections, labels.
3. **Run the self-containment check** (in STYLE.md). If any answer is "you'd need
   this conversation to know that", fix the issue text.
4. **Create it** with the GitHub CLI on `davorrunje/honest-scholar`:

   ```bash
   gh issue create --title "<title>" --body-file <path> [--label "<labels>"] [--milestone "<milestone>"]
   ```

   Write the body to a temp file and pass `--body-file` (avoids shell-quoting
   problems with multi-line Markdown). Add the release milestone when the work is
   release-relevant (e.g. `v0.1.0 — first final`).
5. **Link back.** Print the new issue URL. If the follow-up came from a spec's
   "Follow-ups" list, replace that prose entry with a link to the issue so the
   spec and the tracker don't drift.

## Closing

An issue is never closed silently — a closed issue must record **how** it was
resolved (mirror of the `create-pr` `Closes #NN` rule). Two paths:

- **Resolved by a PR** (the common case): the PR body carries `Closes #NN`
  (per [`create-pr`](../create-pr/SKILL.md)), so merging the PR closes the issue
  and links it automatically. Nothing else to do.
- **Resolved without a PR, or superseded/won't-do**: close it explicitly with a
  one-line resolution comment naming the cause — never a bare close:

  ```bash
  gh issue close <N> --comment "Resolved in <PR/commit/issue> — <one-line what changed>."
  # superseded / won't-do:
  gh issue close <N> --reason "not planned" --comment "Superseded by #<M> — <why>."
  ```

For an **audit/umbrella issue** with a checklist, close it only when every box is
done (or the remainder is re-filed as its own issue) and leave a comment mapping
each item to the PR that fixed it.

## Red flags

- "As we discussed" / "the figure we just made" / "the branch above" — the reader
  has none of that. Name the committed file/PR instead.
- A title like "fix it" or "improve X" with no body — every issue gets the full
  STYLE.md body.
- Deferring work with only a code `TODO` or a spec bullet and no issue.
- Batching many unrelated follow-ups into one issue — one deliverable per issue.
- Closing an issue with no resolution comment and no `Closes #NN` PR.
