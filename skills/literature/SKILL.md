description: >-
  Mines and situates a research literature over one citation-graph substrate
  (OpenAlex + Semantic Scholar). Use when scouting the forward-citation graph for
  research leads (scout mode) or defending a committed claim/paper against prior
  work (position mode); maintains a CSL-JSON bib + triage sidecar. Proposes and
  surfaces — it does not adjudicate novelty; the human decides.
---

One skill, two modes over one citation-graph substrate. `scout` looks **outward**
(generative — mine the graph for leads); `position` looks **inward** (defensive —
situate a committed claim against prior work). Both walk the same graph engine —
**OpenAlex** backbone (free, keyless via `mailto=` polite pool) plus **Semantic
Scholar** for citation contexts, SciCite intents, and recommendations — and both
write to the same registry (a CSL-JSON bib + a YAML triage sidecar). A `level`
parameter (`hypothesis` | `paper` | `thesis`) — the three mirror levels — tunes
ranking, depth, and stopping; it is a *parameter*, not a mode boundary.

This skill **proposes and surfaces**; it never adjudicates. `scout` proposes
leads, `position` surfaces precedent — the human decides what to pursue and what
counts as novel.

## When to use

- **`scout`** — you want research leads mined from who-cited-whom: "what have
  people built on our work / the rivals', and where are the open sub-fronts?"
  Emits ranked idea-backlog rows, each with mandatory provenance.
- **`position`** — you have a committed claim or paper and need to defend it:
  "would a reviewer say this is already known?" (hypothesis) or "write the related
  work + pick baselines" (paper). Emits a precedent verdict or `positioning.md`
  with a PRISMA-style audit trail.
- **Registry upkeep** — record/triage a paper (role, disposition, rationale),
  export `.bib` for a manuscript, or resolve a mirrored PDF.

Not for: running experiments (that's the experiment-backend contract), or
deciding novelty/what to publish (a human sign-off, per the agency principle).

## Modes

| Mode | Direction | For |
|---|---|---|
| `scout` | outward / generative | mine the citation graph for leads → ranked idea-backlog rows |
| `position` | inward / defensive | situate a committed claim/paper → precedent verdict / `positioning.md` |

A `level` parameter (`hypothesis` \| `paper` \| `thesis`) tunes ranking/depth/stopping
— see the per-mode "Level tuning" notes below. Both modes run through the
`honest-scholar literature` CLI (see [Tooling](#tooling)).

## How it works — `scout` mode

Grounding: [../../resources/references/citation-scouting.md](../../resources/references/citation-scouting.md).

Steps 1–5 are `honest-scholar literature` commands (`resolve` / `cites` / `refs` /
`enrich` / `neighbors`) — install via `ensure-tooling`; see [Tooling](#tooling).

1. **Fix the anchor set** — own papers + rival anchors from `.honest-scholar/config.yml`
   (or args). Resolve each to a stable id (DOI / arXiv / OpenAlex / S2).
2. **Pull forward citations** per anchor — OpenAlex `filter=cites:<WORKID>` and
   S2 `/paper/{id}/citations`. Store the raw JSON as the provenance root.
3. **Enrich** each citing paper — year, venue, citation count, authors, and the
   **citation-context snippet + SciCite intent** (Background / Method /
   Result-comparison) plus `isInfluential` from S2.
4. **Filter / rank** — intent (Method / Result-comparison > Background), recency
   (24–36 mo up for fronts), coupling proximity; impact is a tie-breaker only.
5. **Cluster** by co-citation + bibliographic coupling to expose sub-fronts.
6. **Classify** each cluster/paper into an idea type: untested extension,
   contradiction/rival, new domain, transferable technique, or methodological gap.
7. **Emit ranked backlog rows** — one per idea, with **mandatory provenance**:
   `idea | type | source-paper (id) | citing-context snippet | why-it-matters |
   est. feasibility`. The snippet is the auditable link from idea back to
   who-cited-what. Rows land in the relevant `*-exploration` backlog as
   *proposals* the human triages.

**Level tuning.** `hypothesis` → precision: small set, read full text,
context/intent dominates (surface Contrasting / Result-comparison citations).
`paper` → recall: large set, skim metadata, co-citation clustering + research-front
/ burst detection dominates. `thesis` → program-wide recall: mine the whole
program's citation neighborhood across *all* aims (future-work fronts that span
papers), unioned and deduplicated across the papers' sets.

> *e.g.* anchor = the group's ICML'23 paper → a citing paper with a
> **Result-comparison** intent whose snippet reads *"unlike [anchor], our method
> needs no lattice"* → idea row: `type: contradiction/rival | source: <id> |
> snippet: "…no lattice" | why: a competing mechanism to test against |
> feasibility: med`.

## How it works — `position` mode

Grounding: [../../resources/references/related-works-synthesis.md](../../resources/references/related-works-synthesis.md).

Snowball steps use the same `honest-scholar literature` commands (`resolve` /
`cites` / `refs` / `enrich`); see [Tooling](#tooling).

1. **Frame the claim(s)** as 1–3 falsifiable delta statements *before* searching.
2. **Build a diverse seed set** — 3–6 anchors spanning communities/terminologies
   (reduce single-community myopia).
3. **Snowball to saturation** — backward (references → foundations/precedent) +
   forward (citations → newer competitors/SOTA), iterate until no new relevant
   method appears. Log **every** candidate with an include/exclude reason — this
   is the PRISMA-style audit trail (the anti-cherry-picking defense), materialized
   from the triage sidecar (screened + rationale).
4. **Extract a concept-centric matrix** (Webster & Watson): rows = included
   methods, cols = the attributes the delta turns on. Never organize
   author-by-author.
5. **Derive the taxonomy** from the matrix column clusters (the section spine).
6. **Write the per-branch delta** — one sentence per branch, grounded in a matrix
   cell: "Unlike ⟨family⟩ we ⟨difference⟩, which yields ⟨consequence⟩."
7. **Derive baselines from the taxonomy** — one strong tuned representative per
   branch + current SOTA + the most-likely-cited-against + a simplest floor.
   Match splits / tuning budget / compute.

**Level tuning.** `hypothesis` → a fast **adversarial precedent rapid-review**:
"would a reviewer say this is already known?" → verdict + the 1–3 papers that
would reject it + the surviving delta; feeds `strategy.md`. `paper` → full
taxonomy + comparison table + related-work prose + baseline list →
`positioning.md`. `thesis` → the **widest** synthesis: independent related work at
thesis scope, unioned and deduplicated across *every* aim/paper — deliberately
broader than any single paper's `positioning.md` (a PhD's literature footprint
exceeds the union of its published papers) → the kappa's independent related-work
chapter. Ship a PRISMA-style log at **every** level.

## Registry — bib + triage sidecar

Two git-tracked layers joined by citekey/DOI (per ADR-0008, ADR-0020):

**1. Bibliographic facts — CSL-JSON (`references.json`), source of truth.**
Robust to parse/validate/manipulate (the skills append rows, join by key, build
matrices programmatically). Carries the substrate spine fields for the PDF
payload: `pid`/DOI, `files[]` (path + `sha256:…`), `license`, `mirror`. **BibTeX
is exported on demand** (pandoc / Zotero) for LaTeX manuscripts — treat any `.bib`
as a generated view, not the source. Do **not** hand-author `.bib` as the truth.

**2. Triage sidecar — `triage.yml`, keyed by citekey/DOI.** Our decisions about
each paper:

- `role` — anchor / rival / prior-art / support / contrast / neighbor
- `disposition` — state machine: `inbox → screened → interesting → acting →
  acted-on → dismissed`
- `rationale` — why interesting / why dismissed (**doubles as the PRISMA
  include/exclude reason**)
- `priority`, `intent` (SciCite), `seeded` (forward links to backlog items /
  hypotheses / papers this paper inspired), `notes`, reviewer, date

**The triage layer is the literature↔lifecycle connector.** An `acted-on`
disposition spawns a backlog entry (the reference→idea provenance link `scout`
produced); `screened` in/out + rationale across a paper's set *is* the PRISMA log
for `position`.

**PDFs use the shared substrate.** Resolve via the cache → mirror → source chain;
the authoritative checksum is SHA-256 in the registry (see
[../../docs/design/04-substrate-and-contract.md](../../docs/design/04-substrate-and-contract.md) §2). A mirror is
storage, not a redistribution grant — the `license` / `redistributable` fields
gate whether a PDF may be committed vs. mirror-only.

## Composition

- **`hypothesis-exploration` / `paper-exploration`** consume `scout` rows as
  proposals; they apply the idea-shaping lenses (gap-spotting vs. problematization;
  feasibility × interest) — `scout` does not.
- **`hypothesis-testing`** reads `position --level hypothesis` verdicts into
  `strategy.md`. **`paper-synthesis`** reads `position --level paper` into
  `positioning.md` and the baseline list. **`thesis`** reads
  `position --level thesis` into the kappa's independent related-work chapter.
- **`defend`** (target `cited-work`) draws on this registry to check "does ref [12]
  actually support this sentence?" — the same surface-don't-adjudicate posture.
- **Substrate**: shares the persistent-ID / mirror / fixity mechanism with
  `dataset`; both are front-ends over one substrate, not one shared file.

## Guardrails

- **Propose / surface, never adjudicate.** `scout` emits proposals; `position`
  emits precedent + a verdict recommendation. Novelty and what-to-pursue are human
  decisions recorded with sign-off.
- **Provenance is mandatory.** Every `scout` idea row carries the source-paper id
  + exact citing-context snippet. No orphan ideas.
- **PRISMA at every position level.** Every candidate gets an include/exclude
  reason logged (via triage `rationale`); this is the anti-cherry-picking record.
- **Anti-patterns → safeguards:** cherry-picking → PRISMA log + diverse seed set;
  author-by-author prose → concept matrix; overclaiming novelty → adversarial
  precedent search + explicit "closest prior work" + isolating ablation; weak
  baselines → matched tuning/splits, one strong per branch.
- **Keyless-first, degrade gracefully.** OpenAlex needs no key (send `mailto=`).
  Semantic Scholar's key is optional — fall back to OpenAlex-only if absent, at
  the cost of citation contexts/intents. scite.ai is out of scope for v1.
- **License gate is non-negotiable.** Never commit PDF bytes on the strength of a
  mirror; only `redistributable` + a permissive `license` allows in-repo bytes.
- **Reproducibility.** Record the search date, API versions, and query filters in
  the run's provenance; the same anchors + filters should reproduce the set.

## Tooling

The graph work is the **`honest_scholar/literature/graph.py`** module of the
`honest-scholar` package, exposed as the CLI group **`honest-scholar literature`**
(`resolve | cites | refs | enrich | neighbors`), each emitting JSON. **Ensure it
before use** via [`ensure-tooling`](../../resources/ensure-tooling.md) (`uv tool
install honest-scholar`, git/TestPyPI fallbacks). It wraps the OpenAlex + Semantic
Scholar clients, the CSL-JSON bib loader/appender, and the triage-join +
PRISMA-log / concept-matrix generators. Package deps: `requests` + `pyyaml` (+ the
substrate's rclone mirror). Design: `../../docs/design/proposals/literature-citation-graph-client.md`.

> **The endpoints the CLI wraps** (for reference, or a keyless manual check):
> - Forward citations: `curl 'https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:<WORKID>&mailto=<email>&per-page=200'`
>   (paginate via `cursor=*`). Backward: read `referenced_works` on the anchor's work record.
> - Contexts + SciCite intents + `isInfluential`:
>   `curl 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/<id>/citations?fields=contexts,intents,isInfluential,title,year,venue,authors'`
>   (add the `x-api-key` header if a key is configured; omit and degrade to
>   OpenAlex-only otherwise — `cites` marks the result `degraded` when it does).
> - Recommendations (idea expansion):
>   `https://api.semanticscholar.org/recommendations/v1/papers/forpaper/<id>`.
