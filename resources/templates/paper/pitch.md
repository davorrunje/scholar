# Pitch: <working title>

<!-- The committed framing carried over from the promoted portfolio-backlog row.
     Paper-level analog of hypothesis.md. -->

## Central claim

*<The one thing this paper asserts, in one or two sentences.>*

## Contribution

<!-- What is new here — the delta the paper adds to the record. Defended in detail
     in positioning.md against prior work. -->

## Target venue + bar

<!-- Intended venue and the standard it holds contributions to (rigor, novelty,
     baselines expected). Shapes scope and positioning. -->

## Load-bearing hypotheses

<!-- Which hypotheses under docs/research/<paper>/hypotheses/* must resolve for this
     claim to hold. A refuted load-bearing hypothesis blocks the paper (progress
     surfaces it) — that is honest, not failure. -->
