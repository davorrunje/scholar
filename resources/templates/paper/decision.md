# Decision: <paper-id>

<!-- THE PUBLISH / NO-GO VERDICT — a material decision, the paper-level mirror of a
     hypothesis findings verdict. Not real until `signed-off-by` + `signed-off-date`
     are set. The guardrail `grill` fires BEFORE sign-off across positioning
     (novelty), cited-work (sources support claims), and the ledger claims: it
     surfaces gaps; the human may override, override logged — a stop-and-confirm,
     not a hard block. The AI never adjudicates publish-worthiness. -->

## Question

Does the accumulated hypothesis evidence support the contribution `pitch.md`
claims, and does `positioning.md` show a defensible delta against prior work?

## Evidence summary

<!-- Point at the ledger claims and their run-refs; do NOT restate numbers here.
     Confirm every load-bearing claim resolves to grounds (run-refs), and note any
     refuted load-bearing hypothesis (a blocker the human must weigh). -->

- **Ledger:** `ledger.md` — claims C1…Cn, run-refs cited therein
- **Load-bearing hypotheses:** *<resolved? any refuted?>*

## Staleness check

<!-- `is-current` on the cited run-refs before deciding. Stale evidence is surfaced;
     the human decides whether to re-run. -->

## Decision

**`<publish | no-go>`**

<!-- Reasoning tied to the evidence and positioning.
     - publish: contribution supported, delta defensible, bar met.
     - no-go: not yet / not this framing — a valid, completed outcome; note what a
       future paper would need (feeds paper-exploration's limitation-driven lens). -->

*<Reasoning.>*

## Red-team + disclosure closeout

<!-- Adversarial pass before sign-off: strongest reviewer objection and the answer;
     confirm full disclosure (all conditions/runs, incl. nulls). -->

## Grill checkpoint + sign-off

<!-- Guardrail grill outcome (gaps surfaced / resolved / overridden-with-log), then
     the named human records the decision by setting signed-off-by + signed-off-date
     above. -->
