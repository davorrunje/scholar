# Hypothesis: <one-line claim>

<!-- The free-form claim, carried over from the promoted backlog row. No method
     yet — that is strategy.md. State it as a falsifiable sentence: "X does/will Y
     under Z." -->

## Claim

*<State the single falsifiable claim in one or two sentences.>*

## Why it matters

<!-- What does resolving this move? Which paper claim does it feed, and is it
     load-bearing (would refutation invalidate the parent's claim)? Set
     `load-bearing` above accordingly. -->

## What confirmation vs. refutation looks like

<!-- Sketch, in plain language, the observable outcome that would COUNT AS
     confirming and the one that would count as refuting. Both are valid, done
     outcomes — refuted is successful science, not failure. Detailed decision
     rules belong in strategy.md. -->

- **Confirming:** *<...>*
- **Refuting:** *<...>*

## Provenance

<!-- Carried from the backlog row: origin (scouted / EDA / own) + the verbatim
     citing-context snippet or observed pattern. -->
